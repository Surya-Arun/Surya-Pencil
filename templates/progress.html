        <p class="intro">Progress doesn’t happen in a day — it blooms slowly, through patience and passion.  
        I started drawing when I was about 7 or 8… I don’t remember the exact year, but I still remember the feeling — the joy of creating something new.</p>

                    <p>One of My very first attempts — a horse, drawn with wonder and excitement.  
                    It may look simple, but it was where everything began.</p>

                    <p>An elephant sketch — strong yet calm.  
                    It was my first step toward observing and capturing real-life creatures.</p>

                    <p>Drew *Suki* from *Chhota Bheem* — my first attempt at bringing a character to life.  
                    It taught me how expressions can make drawings speak.</p>

                    I began to understand how lines could show liveliness.</p>

                    This artwork represents how far I’ve come — from a curious child to an artist who draws with soul.</p>
